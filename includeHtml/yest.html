		<h1>How Is Yeast Different to Sourdough Starter?</h1>
		<h2>
			The truth is, sourdough starter is full of yeast 
			- it's just a different kind of yeast to  commercial yeast. 
			So while sourdough starter is different to commercial yeast, 
			it can get confusing because in essence, 
			sourdough starter is natural, wild yeast.
